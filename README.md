# Book Your Flight: The App

So it turns out if you have friends coming into town for a hackathon you actually have to relearn how to code. I'm rereading the Android Programming book from '96 or whenever it was I was an Apprentice with Labs. The good ol' days. 

Made some custom changes to the assigned project for you Stu-dog. Used Git commits and even used logs at one point because the code broke. 

Then I deleted the logs. Why? Because I'm a stone-cold professional.
